## Overview

[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)  is a widely-used issue and project tracking software by Atlassian. It provides a REST API that allows applications to connect with Jira to create, update, and delete various resources, enabling efficient project and task management.

The `ballerinax/jira` package offers APIs to interact with the [Jira REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro), providing access to various endpoints for managing issues, filters, projects, and other resources.

## Setup guide

To use the Jira connector, you must have a Jira Cloud account with API access. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a Jira account on [Atlassianâ€™s website](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/).

### Step 1: Create an API Token
1. Login to [Atlassian Account](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/)

You have successfully integrated jira with your atlassian account. Now you can access the services through the API

## Quickstart

To use the `Twitter` connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### step 1: Import the module

Import the `jira` module.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/jira;
```
### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

1. Create a `Config.toml` file and, configure the obtained credentials in the above steps as follows:

```bash
baseUrl = "<Jira Cloud Domain URL>"
username = "<Your Atlassian Account Email>"
apiToken = "<Your Jira API Token>"
```

2. Create a `twitter:ConnectionConfig` with the obtained access token and initialize the connector with it.

```ballerina
configurable string baseUrl = ?;
configurable string username = ?;
configurable string apiToken = ?;

final jira:Client jiraClient = check new({
    baseUrl: baseUrl,
    auth: {
        username: username,
        password: apiToken
    }
});
```
### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

#### create an issue

```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {
    jira:ProjectRole role = check jiraClient->/rest/api/3/role.post(
        payload = {
            name: roleName,
            description: roleDescription
        }
    );
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

```bash
bal run
```
