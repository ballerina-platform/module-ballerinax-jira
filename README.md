## Overview

[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is a powerful project management and issue tracking platform developed by Atlassian, widely used for agile software development, bug tracking, and workflow management.

The `ballerinax/jira` package provides APIs to connect and interact with Jiraâ€™s REST API endpoints, enabling seamless integration for operations such as managing issues, projects, users, and workflows. The latest version corresponds to the [REST API version 3 (Cloud)](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/), which builds upon v2 with additional support such as Atlassian Document Format (ADF) in fields like comments and descriptions.

## Setup guide

5. Store the access token securely for use in your application.

## Quickstart

To use the `Jira` connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `jira` module.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/jira;
```
### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

1. Create a `Config.toml` file and, configure the obtained credentials in the above steps as follows:

```toml
username = "<your email>"
password = "<Access Token>"
```
2. Create a jira:ConnectionConfig with the obtained access token and initialize the connector with it.

```ballerina
configurable string username = ?;
configurable string password = ?;

jira:ConnectionConfig config = {
    auth: {
        username,
        password
    }
};

final jira:Client jiraClient = check new(config,<"your-organization-id.atlassian.net/rest>">);
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

#### Get the user

```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {
    jira:User user = check jiraClient->/api/'3/myself;
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

```bash
bal run
```
