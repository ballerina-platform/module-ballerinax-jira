## OpenAPI cli command

The following command was used to generate the Ballerina client from the OpenAPI specification. The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal openapi -i docs/spec/openapi.yaml  --mode client -o ballerina
```
Note: The license year is hardcoded to 2024, change if necessary.
